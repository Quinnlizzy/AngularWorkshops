a reactive SPA

on html page and - url seem to visit diff pages
bunch of js code from server - every change is rendered in browser therefore very reactive experience
easier than reaching out to serverlook and feel almost like mob apps

every click just changes on html page
js changes the dom - changes the html during runtime - so no refresh - just changing loaded page
one single html element
